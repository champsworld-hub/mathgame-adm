## 🔒 Firestore Security Rules

Users can only read/write their own data:

```
/students/{uid}           → auth.uid == uid
/scores/{uid}/trials/{*} → auth.uid == uid
```

---

## 🧮 Math Engine Rules

- Number₁ is always positive
- Subsequent numbers are randomly + or −
- **Boundary condition:** if `CurrentTotal − NextVal < 0`, operator is forced to `+`
- Total never goes negative at any step
- Difficulty controls digit count and number of terms:
  - Easy: 1-digit numbers, 3 terms
  - Medium: 2-digit numbers, 5 terms
  - Hard: 2-digit numbers, 7 terms
  - Custom:
